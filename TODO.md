# TODO: Implement Card Stacking Animation for Reviews Section

## Steps to Complete

- [ ] Import Flip from 'gsap/Flip' and register the plugin in pages/Home.tsx
- [ ] Restructure the reviews section to include a slider container with review cards as items (divs with class "item")
- [ ] Adapt the moveCard function to create new div elements (instead of img) and copy the content of the last item
- [ ] Add a click event listener to the slider to trigger the Flip animation
- [ ] Style the review cards appropriately for stacking
- [ ] Test the click animation to ensure cards stack and animate correctly
- [ ] Verify GSAP Flip integration works without conflicts
